There are several ways to play the game from inside the Unity Editor.

### Quick play in a test scene
We have created a playground scene that contains a sample of the game's functionality. This is great to use as a sandbox to develop your own functionality or make modifications to existing game's systems.

Simply open the scene `/Scenes/WIP/` named TestingGround, and press Play. For older computers, you can use the scene named TestingGround_Small, which should run better on older hardware.

### Play the entire game
To play the game from the beginning, start from the scene Initialization, contained in `/Scenes/`. This replicates the flow that the players experience in the game build.

**Note:** as this project is a work in progress, you won't be able to experience "the full game" experience right now.

### Create a new scene
To create a new scene and be able to control the character in it, follow the setup instructions in the [specific page](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/wiki/Creating-a-new-playable-scene).
