Welcome to the Wiki for Open Project #1: Chop Chop!

This is intended to be an instruction manual. (Almost) all of the game's systems and components are explained here, so you can download the project using Git, and start exploring it using this Wiki as documentation.

All pages are in continuous evolution as the game changes during its development, so check them out again before you modify a system, to make sure you are up to date with the changes.

If you want to contribute to the game, don't forget to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwBF4yQl69RxvVHZ2m2iiy5pYjd9QO-VcuXWDjB7QwA/edit#) first! They contain a lot of important things you should know before you make your first contribution. And especially for programmers, check out the [Code Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-eUWZ0lWREFu5iH-ggofwnixDDQqalOoT4Yc0NpWR3k/edit?usp=sharing) or, for artists, the [Art Contribution guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18zqe31J8EipTiEBZuwzLyG3jH7-5teAOViLEio4uko8/edit).
